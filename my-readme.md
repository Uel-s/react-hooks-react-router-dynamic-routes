## Learning Goals

- Create nested routes in React Router
- Use URL parameters in React Router
- Use the `useRouteMatch` and `useParams` hooks to access information about
  React Router's internal state

# Nesting

Here we want to see a specific route not list them side by side as before i.e;
 we can set up the list/detail pattern by using React Router to make our `Item` component the _child_ of the
`List` component.
